# MIT-Code-For-Good
This is the short script I wrote with two other teammates for TutoringPlus, an education non-profit in Cambridge, MA dedicated to improving education equality by providing free tutoring services to students. This script (written in Google Script, a JavaScript-based language) helps TutoringPlus automate their attendance taking in Google Sheets. You can read more about the project in this [project presentation], including a video demo I made.
